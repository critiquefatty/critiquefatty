C:\Users\preju\Desktop\Dachuan\v8-test\ncnn-android-yolov8-main\ncnn-android-yolov8\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:11: Warning: Redundant label can be removed [RedundantLabel]
                  android:label="@string/app_name"
                  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "RedundantLabel":
   When an activity does not have a label attribute, it will use the one from
   the application tag. Since the application has already specified the same
   label, the label on this activity can be omitted.

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
C:\Users\preju\Desktop\Dachuan\v8-test\ncnn-android-yolov8-main\ncnn-android-yolov8\app\build.gradle:22: Warning: A newer version of com.android.support:support-v4 than 24.0.0 is available: 28.0.0 [GradleDependency]
        implementation 'com.android.support:support-v4:24.0.0'
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

C:\Users\preju\Desktop\Dachuan\v8-test\ncnn-android-yolov8-main\ncnn-android-yolov8\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:12: Warning: Expecting android:screenOrientation="unspecified" or "fullSensor" for this activity so the user can use the application in any orientation and provide a great experience on Chrome OS devices [LockedOrientationActivity]
                  android:screenOrientation="portrait">
                  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "LockedOrientationActivity":
   The <activity> element should not be locked to any orientation so that
   users can take advantage of the multi-window environments and larger
   screens available on Android. To fix the issue, consider declaring the
   corresponding activity element with `screenOrientation="unspecified"or
   "fullSensor"` attribute.

                  android:screenOrientation="portrait">
                  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "DiscouragedApi":
   Discouraged APIs are allowed and are not deprecated, but they may be unfit
   for common use (e.g. due to slow performance or subtle behavior).

C:\Users\preju\Desktop\Dachuan\v8-test\ncnn-android-yolov8-main\ncnn-android-yolov8\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:6: Error: Permission exists without corresponding hardware <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" required="false"> tag [PermissionImpliesUnsupportedChromeOsHardware]
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "PermissionImpliesUnsupportedChromeOsHardware":
   The <uses-permission> element should not require a permission that implies
   an unsupported large screen hardware feature. Google Play assumes that
   certain hardware related permissions indicate that the underlying hardware
   features are required by default. To fix the issue, consider declaring the
   corresponding <uses-feature> element with required="false" attribute.

C:\Users\preju\Desktop\Dachuan\v8-test\ncnn-android-yolov8-main\ncnn-android-yolov8\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:10: Warning: As of Android 12, android:exported must be set; use true to make the activity available to other apps, and false otherwise. For launcher activities, this should be set to true. [IntentFilterExportedReceiver]
        <activity android:name="MainActivity"
         ~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "IntentFilterExportedReceiver":
   Apps targeting Android 12 and higher are required to specify an explicit
   value for android:exported when the corresponding component has an intent
   filter defined. Otherwise, installation will fail. Set it to true to make
   this activity accessible to other apps, and false to limit it to be used
   only by this app or the OS. For launch activities, this should be set to
   true; otherwise, the app will fail to launch.

   Previously, android:exported for components without any intent filters
   present used to default to false, and when intent filters were present, the
   default was true. Defaults which change value based on other values are
   confusing and lead to apps accidentally exporting components as a
   side-effect of adding intent filters. This is a security risk, and we have
   made this change to avoid introducing accidental vulnerabilities.

   While the default without intent filters remains unchanged, it is now
   required to explicitly specify a value when intent filters are present. Any
   app failing to meet this requirement will fail to install on any Android
   version after Android 11.

   We recommend setting android:exported to false (even on previous versions
   of Android prior to this requirement) unless you have a good reason to
   export a particular component.

    <application android:label="@string/app_name">
     ~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "MissingApplicationIcon":
   You should set an icon for the application as whole because there is no
   default. This attribute must be set as a reference to a drawable resource
   containing the image (for example @drawable/icon).

C:\Users\preju\Desktop\Dachuan\v8-test\ncnn-android-yolov8-main\ncnn-android-yolov8\app\src\main\res\layout\main.xml:16: Warning: Hardcoded string "切换摄像头", should use @string resource [HardcodedText]
        android:text="切换摄像头" />
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "HardcodedText":
   Hardcoding text attributes directly in layout files is bad for several
   reasons:

   * When creating configuration variations (for example for landscape or
   portrait) you have to repeat the actual text (and keep it up to date when
   making changes)

   * The application cannot be translated to other languages by just adding
   new translations for existing string resources.

   There are quickfixes to automatically extract this hardcoded string into a
   resource lookup.
